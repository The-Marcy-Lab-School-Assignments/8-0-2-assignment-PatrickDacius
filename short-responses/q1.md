# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
The danger of making a API request with api keys from the frontend is that your API key is visible and not hidden. Making API request from the server avoids this danger because the backend (server) does not allow access to any user, only developers have access to the backend side of the application, keeping the API keys truly hidden
